## Notes

* Quick note: this course, like the parallel programming one, does not have a visual of the person talking to you 
* Overview of Census data 
* `geography` paramater in tidycenus defines level of aggregration, this could be by state, county, or tract and many others, here's a breakdown <https://walkerke.github.io/tidycensus/articles/basic-usage.html#geography-in-tidycensus> 
    + There are optional `state` and `county` subsetting aruments so that you aren't returned aggregate date for the whole US 
    + you can also specify whether your data comes in long or wide format with `output` 
* You can look for census variables here<https://censusreporter.org/> or by using the `loadvariables` function to download and browe census variables from the census website. You can then use the tidyverse package to narrow your search 
* Review of ggplot2 
*
