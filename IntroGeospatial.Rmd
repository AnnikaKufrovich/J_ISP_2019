## Notes
* Quick look at how to use ggmaps with ggplot to with a dataset on houses sold in corvallis 
* To add aesthetics `ggmap()` add the argument `base_layer) 
* You can also use the qmap function 
* Types of spatial data include point, line, polygon, and raster 
  + Line: collections of points in a line connected by lines 
  + Polygon: points associated with an area, ordered points matter 
  + Raster: gridded, think satellite data and a rectangular grid it captured 
* sp package can store objects spatially for point, line, and polygon data 
* S4 is one of the object oriented systems in R, some object oriented concepts are: 
    + Class: defines a type of object, their attributes and their relationhip to other classses 
    + Methods: are functions, their behaviour depends on the class of object used as input 
* S4 objects have slots, which can store anything 
    + To access slots you can use a dedicated method the way you would use a function, ie use the slot you want to access as a function 
    + You could also reference the object, followed by the slot use the @ symbol in the sameway you would use the $ for data frame 
    + Another option is to use the `slot()` function with the object as the first arument, and the second argument is the slot you want to access in quotes 
* There's a heirarchy in sp objects for polygons, lines, and points 
* tmap is like ggplot2 in its additive way of working with plots, but it expects data in spatial objects rather than dataframes 
* A more intuitive way of storing raster data is in a matrix where each cell coresponds to a cell in the grid
* Quick review of how to use color in plots
* tmap uses the package classInt to bin continuous variables



## Practice/Application

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(sp)
library(tmap)
library(ggplot2)
library(rasterVis)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(classInt)
```
