##Notes

* Starts with review of relational Operators, I know these: ==, !=, <, >, <=, and >= 
    + One thing is that these operators work for strings in alphebetical order 
* Review of logical operators, know these as well, &, |, and ! 
* && and || only evaluate the first element of a vector 
* Review of if and else statements and while/for loops 
* Skipped functions chapter because larger course on functions 
* Apply family 
    + lapply can apply a function (such as class) to all the components of something (like a list or vector) and always returns a list unless 
    + sapply does what lapply does but automatically puts the output into a vector, array, or matrix, however, sapply returns a list if outcome vectors are not the same length
    + vapply
