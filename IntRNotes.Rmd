##Notes

* Starts with review of relational Operators, I know these: ==, !=, <, >, <=, and >= 
    + One thing is that these operators work for strings in alphebetical order 
* Review of logical operators, know these as well, &, |, and ! 
* && and || only evaluate the first element of a vector 
* Review of if and else statements and while/for loops 
* Skipped functions chapter because larger course on functions 
* Apply family 
    + lapply can apply a function (such as class) to all the components of something (like a list or vector) and always returns a list
    + sapply does what lapply does but automatically puts the output into a vector, array, or matrix, however, sapply returns a list if outcome vectors are not the same length 
    + vapply is like lapply and sapply but you have to specify the form of the output 
* reviewing general mathematical functions, know these
* regular expressions
    + grep
    + grepl looks for a pattern (indicated by a regex) in something, returns logical output
    + sub
    + gsub


## Practice

Decided not to practice most of material from intermediate R course because most was review

```{r}
```


## Goals for tomorrow
* Finish data camp functions course
* Try to figure out a function that checks if a row from new voter file matches one in older voter file (will do this with smaller county level voter file)
  + will add a column with TRUE outcomes for matched voters and FALSE for unmatched voters for verification
* If this works, continue to create lon/lat columns that take geocoded lon/lat of old matched voters and puts those values in the new lon/lat columns of new matched voters
    + This should leave only new voters and moved voters without lon/lat values (ie all original falses should not have lon/lat)
*Note: final function requires the use of 3 datasets: old ungeocoded voter file, new ungeocoded file voter file, and old geocoded voter file. If I take the old geocoded dataset, I should simply have to use dplyr to remove the lon/lat columns to create the old ungeocoded dataset. While having all 3 datasets downloaded is certainly possible, this or finding a way to ignore the lon/lat columns in my initial comparison
